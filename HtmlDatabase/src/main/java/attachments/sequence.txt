DISTINCT SUBSEQUENCES

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

A subsequence of a given sequence S consists of S with zero or more elements deleted. Formally, a sequence Z = z1z2..zk is a subsequence of X = x1x2...xm, if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of indicies of X such that for all j=1,2,...k we have Xij = Zj. E.g. Z=bcdb is a subsequence of X=abcbdab with corresponding index sequence <2,3,5,7>

INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file contains two comma separated strings. The first is the sequence X and the second is the subsequence Z. E.g.


1)  babgbag,bag
2)  rabbbit,rabbit
