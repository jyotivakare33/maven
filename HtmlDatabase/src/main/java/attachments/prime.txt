Write a program that takes L and R as input and displays the number of prime numbers that lie between L and R (L and R inclusive) and can be represented as sum of two consecutive prime numbers + 1. 

Your program should accept a path to a file as its first argument that contains <= 40 number of lines. Each line is a test case represented by a pair of integers.

Example:

Case 1:

	For the input provided as follows:

	1 20

	Output of the program will be:

	2

	Explanation

	13 is a prime number which can be expressed like 5+7+1.
	19 is a prime number which can be expressed like 7+11+1.
	So output is 2.
	Note that 5 and 7 are consecutive primes. Similarly 7 and 11 are consecutive primes.

Case 2:

	For the input provided as follows:

	1 10

	Output of the program will be:

	0

	Explanation

	No prime numbers lie between 1 and 10 that can be represented as sum of two consecutive prime numbers + 1, hence 0 is displayed.
