ADVANCED CALCULATOR
CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

The goal of this challenge is to create an advanced calculator. 
The following operations should be supported with their order (operator precedence): 
    Pi        Pi number
    e         Eulers number
    sqrt()    Square root
    cos()     Cosine (using radians as an argument)
    sin()     Sine (using radians as an argument)
    tan()     Tangent (using radians as an argument)
    lg()      Decimal logarithm
    ln()      Natural logarithm
1   ()        Brackets
2   ||        Absolute value, e.g. |-5 - 10|
3   !         Factorial
4   -         Unary minus
5   ^         Exponent
6   mod       Modulus divide, e.g. 5 mod 2 = 1 (only integers will be supplied here)
7   *, /      Multiply, Divide (left-to-right precedence)
8   +, -      Add, Subtract (left-to-right precedence)
INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case. Each line contains mathematical expression. E.g.

250*14.3
3^6 / 117
(2.16 - 48.34)^-1
(59 - 15 + 3*6)/21
lg(10) + ln(e)
15*5 mod 2


OUTPUT SAMPLE:

For each set of input produce a single line of output which is the result of calculation.
